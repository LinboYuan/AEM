Android event manager is an utility class to simplify android listeners. It has encapsulated most of the view event listeners. When bind an event to a view, you just need declare a method that has the same signature with the event, and annotate it with the EventAnnotation.

We will get rid of the fussy listener's implementation by this utility. It is easy to use and uncouples activity with the views' event. Meanwhile, it has a good performance.

It is open source and free to use.
